# Mapping African Public Transit

<img src="project-card.png" width="400">

Motivation: Most African urban areas rely on some form of informal or semi-formal transport. However, only 15 African cities have mapped their public transport systems in a standardized and open format, meaning that over 105 million people do not have reliable transit information. The lack of data presents a major barrier to improving and accessing transportation.

Goal: Work with African municipalities to develop standardised public transit data and maps

Interests: Africa, public transit, urban planning, geospatial data analysis, mapping, global development

Skills: Literature review, research, data manipulation
